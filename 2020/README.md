# advent-of-code-2020

My solutions to advent of code using [vlang](https://vlang.io). If you are looking for the best solution to these problems, you won't find it here. I just want to write some naive code. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

> No spoilers.

## compile and run

```sh
$ v --version
V 0.1.30 b1bff3f
```

```sh
$ v 1.v && ./1
```

Input via STDIN just like the OGs.
